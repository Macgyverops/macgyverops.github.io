# Who am I?

DevOps Advocate, Site Reliability Engineer by trade, general Tinkerer. Just a few terms that describe me but I strive to be like MacGyver; the original with Richard Dean Anderson.  If you'd like a professional CV please see the link below.  

# What does DevOps mean to me?

I started my DevOps Journey in 2015 when my manager at the time gave me a goal to join the greater community of technology folks. He asked me in very broad terms to deploy myself in the community in one way or another; to contribute to the field but also to get a greater understanding,  "big picture" if you will. That's where I met my friend Jerry Cattell. I asked if I could volunteer but being so early in the year Jerry asked if i'd like to help organize instead. I tend to get more than I bargained for but if it weren't for that faithful email reply from Jerry the Pheonix Project would only have been a book I read that one time and not what I am passionate about today.

I've not only helped organize DevOpsDays Chicago since 2015 but I've also given some Ignite talks at DevOpsDays Kansas City, Detriot, Atlanta. Links below! It really has been a journey the DevOps culture is growing and blossuming. 

# Other Interests

Animal Advocacy & Rescue. I've been volunteering with dogs and cats for 6 years. I've worked with PAWS Chicago serving in mulitple volunteer positions such as dog handling and training, cat handling, and philantrophy. I've ran the Chicago Marathon with Team PAWS and i've raised over $10,000 over the past 6 years. The look of abandonment is soul crushing but it does happen and I heard the call to help these animals mend their hearts. I've made so many friends along the way and I believe it will stick with me for the rest of my days.

# What is MacGyverOps mean?

MacGyver the original show in 1985 was one of my favorite shows growing up.  I strive to be more like MacGyver every day.
